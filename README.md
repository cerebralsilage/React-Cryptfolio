# Cryptfolio

This site was built with React 18, CoinGeco API, and React-HighCharts.  It is hosted [here on netlify.](https://sensational-queijadas-85639a.netlify.app/)  

Careful clicking on too many things at once as the API only allows 50 calls a minute, which isn't much when you consider the charts calls 5 requests at once.
